      <p> Hi, my name is Damir Gafic and I am applying for the Summer Software Engineer Intern Role. The most important thing I am looking to learn
        at an internship is what it is like to be a Software Engineer in a professional environment. I know when you are working in a professional environment
        you must be much more meticulous with the way code is written. So, I want to dive deeper into what I know and actually learn what is done in an engineering
        to make sure code is written efficiently. I would have many questions to fellow co-workers if I was accepted and would not take this opportunity for granted.
        I want to become a great Software Engineer one day, and this would be a great opportunity to learn from Software Engineers in the industry already. I have experience with many different technologies and am always excited to learn new stuff.
        So, I would be open to any type of software projects given to me. Thanks for reading this, and I hope you consider me for the role.
